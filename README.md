Oticon More Hearing aid Settings

Note - Two sets of Hearing aids were fit in Bellingham, WA to a hearing loss of 25 sloping to 40 dB. Although hearing aids were switched from open domes to occluded domes, both sets of hearing aids were fit in the Oticon software indicating "open bass domes, general, VAC+".

Noise Conditions

N1 = Restaraunt noise at -150deg, track 5 from a Widex noise cd from Doug Sladen
N2 = Babble noise at 150deg, List 9 from AzBIo
N3 = Both noises at the same time

Noises were played using a seperate 2 channel system and played continuously while the spondees were presented from -75 to 75 degrees (left to right each run)

Intensity Levels
  In anechoic condition, spondees presented at 55 dB, rest noise at 50 dB, babble at 50 dB. Thus, in quiet +5dB SNR
